# TODO

* Rename DOMAINO --> EXPIRED
* Use domain WHOIS contacts for alerts
* Bright Verify for settings.additional_emails
* ignore Timeout::Error in DNS validation service
* ignore herokuapp.com domains, add placeholder with "Custom Domains"
* extract 2-nd level domains only for WHOIS (TBD - maybe not needed? Use cache to avoid too many calls?)
* Time Zone configuration for preferred notification timeframe (auto-detect via IP geolocation)
* Wildcard domains support
* Limit on the number of domains in PLANS
* Checks should be "combined"
