## Motivation

Despite modern technologies used, there are still outstanding domain expiration stories published every several months.
This story explains why automated solutions are not always the remedy: https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/crates-io-expiry-postmortem-2016-11-07/4344

We need a simple and bullet-proof mechanism to protect from such expirations.

IF YOUR DOMAIN EXPIRES IN A WEEK, SOMEBODY SHOULD TAKE THE PHONE AND CALL YOU!
